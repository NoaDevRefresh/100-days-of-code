# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a structure and a plan for the project. Set up all the config and first html, css and js files. Set up the git config as well. All ready to scale it. 

**The Project: I want to improve my vanilla Javascript skills so i decided to work in a very simple media player project and code daily plugins that add functions progresssively.

**Thoughts:** After years coding web and React I realize sometimes I don't know exactly how things work under the framework and I think I can improve my coding greatly by understanding the bases of web programming. I have so much to learn yet, and that's awesome!

### Day 2: July 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added the first plugin Autoplay that plays the video as soon as the page charges. Also added a mute button because the browser won't allow autoplay with sound (accesibility related) so it starts muted and needed a button to unmute. 

**Future work: The styles are terrible since I'm focusing on the functionality first. This will need work at some point.

**Thoughts:** I got to work with media objects and learnt some things about them.
