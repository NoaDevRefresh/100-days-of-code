# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a structure and a plan for the project. Set up all the config and first html, css and js files. Set up the git config as well. All ready to scale it. 

**The Project: I want to improve my vanilla Javascript skills so i decided to work in a very simple media player project and code daily plugins that add functions progresssively.

**Thoughts:** After years coding web and React I realize sometimes I don't know exactly how things work under the framework and I think I can improve my coding greatly by understanding the bases of web programming. I have so much to learn yet, and that's awesome!
